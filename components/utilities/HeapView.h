// A heap view is an imaginary overlay for a memory buffer so it can be treated like
// a stand-alone heap.

// In other words, it is a guide telling the caller where to allocate a request in an
// actual buffer. The heap view itself assumes infinite capacity, so it is the caller's
// job to make sure their buffer can fit an allocation at the suggested byte offset.

// The heap view doesn't do any allocations itself. It simply maintains the positions 
// and sizes of imaginary ones.
