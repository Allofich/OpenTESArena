## Contributing

If you'd like to report a problem or a bug you've found, feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/issues) tab or leave a comment on a commit. If you'd like to contribute something, open a [pull request](https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/pulls) and I'll take a look at it. You can also take a look at the [Projects](https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/projects) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/wiki) for the current to-do's and the project roadmap. I'm not really accepting feature requests yet because there are so many low-level components left to do first!

### File Structure
All source filenames are UpperCamelCase and use .h or .cpp extensions. 

This is the typical layout of the C++ header files:
```C++
#include <standard lib 1.h>
#include <standard lib 2.h>

#include "dependencies like SDL.h"

#include "LocalSourceFile1.h"
#include "LocalSourceFile2.h"
#include "../SomeFolder/LocalSourceFile3.h"

// Forward declarations.
class SomeClass;

enum class SomeEnumClass;

class ExampleClass
{
private:
	// Private members.
	
	// Private methods.
public:
	// Constructors.
	// Destructor.
	
	// Static const class declarations.
	
	// Public methods (getters first, setters and voids second).
};
```

And the .cpp files:
```C++
#include <standard lib 3.h>
#include <standard lib 4.h>

#include "ExampleClass.h"
#include "LocalSourceFile4.h"
#include "../SomeFolder/LocalSourceFile5.h"
#include "../SomeFolder/LocalSourceFile6.h"

namespace
{
	// Constant global data relevant to this file.
}

// Static const class definitions.

ExampleClass::ExampleClass(/* Args. */)
	// Initializer list for non-trivial classes and structs.
{
	// Primitive initializations.
}

ExampleClass::~ExampleClass()
{
	// Usually empty, except for SDL types.
}

// Getters.

// Setters and voids.
```

### Coding Style
We're using modern C++, so we regularly use all of the nice features like:
- `std::array`, `std::string`, `std::unique_ptr`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::vector`
- `nullptr`
- `enum class`
- Lambdas
- Standard library functions (`std::count()`, `std::find()`, `std::sort()`, etc.)
- Bounds-checking (i.e., `std::vector::at()`)
- `auto` (only for really long names. It's usually better to just write the type anyway)
- Range-based for loops (i.e., `for (const auto &obj : someVector)`)
- Move semantics via `std::move()`

#### Other Notes
- Prefer pure functions and immutable data.
- Avoid mutable globals and static variables.
- `new` and `delete` should never be necessary. `std::make_unique` takes care of that for us.
- Use post-increment (`i++`) everywhere except with iterators, in which case use pre-increment (`++iter`) to avoid unnecessary copies.
- Code should work in both 32-bit and 64-bit, and on Windows, Linux, and macOS (fortunately, SDL2 and the C++ standard library take care of a lot of this for us).
- Alphabetize each group of header includes. This makes it much easier to find the one you're looking for (via binary search!). Code is read much more often than it is written.
- Personally, I use `this` for accessing class members. It is very convenient to use with Visual Studio's auto-complete, it keeps local variables unambiguous, and I've never needed to mangle the names of class members with sigils.
- Follow the formatting of nearby code (i.e., if it uses tabs instead of spaces, then use tabs).
