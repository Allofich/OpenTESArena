## Samples

These images are from my test project I did around the middle of January 2016 to demonstrate what the world might end up looking like with a simple ray tracer as the graphics engine.

Later on, I would like to add more effects like soft shadows, etc., once the rendering pipeline is more efficient. Also, some of the windows in the images here are white because they're a "special case" in the renderer (black during the day, yellow at night). I'd like to add a reflective texture in addition to the color textures so windows can have reflections.
