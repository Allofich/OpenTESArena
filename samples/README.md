## Tech demo images

These are from my test project in Jan. 2016 that demonstrated what the world could look like with a simple ray tracer. There was hardly anything resembling an engine yet; just enough to run an OpenCL renderer and read in some PNGs of Arena's textures. The pixel-perfect shadows were a highlight though, all done in a compute shader before GPU ray tracing was popularized.
