// A character equipment object is designed for humanoids with a head, chest, two
// shoulders, two arms, two legs, and two feet.

// All of the pointer members refer to inventory items. I didn't use "weak_ptr"
// or something similar because raw pointers are behaving as intended here, and 
// there is no memory management to worry about.

// Null is valid to return when nothing is equipped in a slot. Returning a vector
// with a size of zero is also valid.

// I'm not sure how indexing is going to work, because Arena's equipped items don't 
// have a distinct spot in the interface like Daggerfall does (i.e., ring #1 and #2), 
// but they do have an order that they are equipped (first in, first out). However, 
// unequipping a particular item by clicking on it may not be straightforward to 
// code. Display name matching in the "getAccessories()" or "getTrinkets()" vectors 
// should be sufficient for solving that problem, and duplicates will simply get 
// one of them unequipped.
